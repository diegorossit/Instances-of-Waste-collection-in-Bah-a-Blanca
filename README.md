# Instances-of-Waste-collection-in-BAHIA-BLANCA
These files are the instances of waste generaiton in Bah√≠a Blanca that were used in the manuscript submitted for revision to the journal Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering with title: "Routing in waste collection: a simulated annealing algorithm for an Argentinean case study"

The files correspond to the instances F2 and F3 used in manuscript. There are four files:
F2.csv: gives data of the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the depot and the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude), sector of the city (A or B) and waste generation (humid and dry waste) of the GAPs -j1 to j137-.
F2_distances.csv: gives data of the urban distances in kilometres between the depots and GAPs in a 2D matrix.
F3.csv: gives data of the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the depot and the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude), sector of the city (A or B) and waste generation (humid and dry waste) of the GAPs -j1 to j180-.
F3_distances.csv: gives data of the urban distances in kilometres between the depots and GAPs in a 2D matrix
